# Notes

## Styling
A simple styling for the site.
We display various pieces of data with the focus being on showcasing the main subscriptions and their price.
We add a relative price bar here, against the most expensive one -- this is a good visual.

Beneath we add more fine-grained information per entry, such as: email used, people shared to, weekly|monthly|yearly cost and renewal date.

We also add a category focused metric, showing for the total monthly spending which takes the most.

## To Do
+ we still need to add user-input code
+ split the js file into smaller chunks for ease of understanding and fixing
+ Fix the dialogue and form section to appear when buttons pressed
+ Find a way to add/remove/edit subscription information
